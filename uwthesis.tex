%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because

%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation

\abstract{%
This sample dissertation is an aid to students who are attempting
to format their theses with \LaTeX, a sophisticated
text formatter widely used by mathematicians and scientists everywhere.
 
\begin{itemize}
\item It describes the use of a specialized
macro package developed specifically for thesis production
at the University.
The macros customize \LaTeX\ for the correct thesis style,
allowing the student to concentrate on the substance of
his or her text.%
\footnote{See Appendix A to obtain the source to this
 thesis and the class file.}
\item It demonstrates the solutions to a variety of
formatting challenges found in thesis production.
\item It serves as a template for a real dissertation.

the document you are reading, {\tt uwthesis.tex},
contains many formatting examples
which you may find useful.
The bibliography database, {\tt uwthesis.bib}, contains instructions
to BibTeX to create and format the bibliography.
